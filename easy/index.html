EASY Challenge:
A local gym wants to implement an "exercise of the day" program where there is a free class for that day that promotes a certain exercise. The gym needs some backend logic to update its system to reflect which exercise will be promoted that day. Write a function that will take as an input the name of an exercise and console log a message like Today's exercise: running
 Write one function that can dynamically print the value of the exercise for that day, and it must be closure.
 
// Output: Today's exercise: Running
  console.log(exercise("Running")); 
// Output: Today's exercise: Swimming
  console.log(exercise("Swimming"));
// Output: Today's exercise: Dancing
  console.log(exercise("Dancing")); 
// Output: Today's exercise: Fencing
  console.log(exercise("Fencing"));
