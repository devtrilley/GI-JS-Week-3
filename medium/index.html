MEDIUM: 
Write a function that will allow you to calculate how many slices of pizza (x) each person (y) would get if they shared evenly. The function should return an interpolated string like...

"Each person gets 4.00 slices of pizza; from our 8-slice pizza" 
  - x being a decimal in case there is no way to split the pizza evenly.

// Output: Each person gets 4 slices of pizza; from our 8 slice pizza
  console.log(sharePizza(8, 2)); 
// Output: Each person gets 2.67 slices of pizza; from our 8 slice pizza
  console.log(sharePizza(8, 3)); 
// Output: Each person gets 1.05 slices of pizza; from our 21 slice pizza
  console.log(sharePizza(21, 20));
// Output:Each person gets 3.33 slices of pizza; from our 10 slice pizza
  console.log(sharePizza(10, 3));
